JDK (Java development kit) , JVM (Java virtual machine) and JRE (Java runtime environment)

For running java code in our system we need these 3 tools.
JDK converts java code to byte code and this byte code will be executed inside JVM
Sometimes we may use some inbuilt classes or libraries and we may need to use these
codes and for this we have extra layer around the JVM which is JRE .JRE provides
the extra files that need to run our code.

So basically our code runs inside JVM and JRE provides the files that are required
to run it. JDK is the top layer , hence when we install JDK it has the JRE and JVM.

Stack and Heap:

We have a main method and a class Calculator . the class calculator has a instance variable num
and a method add.
The main has a data variable and a reference variable obj which is creating an object for
class Calculator

Class methods:

Method overloading:
Inside a class we can define methods of same name but it should we of different parameter
in type or size. Eg : we can have public int add(int n1, int n2) and then int add(int n1)
This is method overloading

Array :

In Java , when we define an array , its size is fixed we cannot modify it. Eg : int num[] = {1, 2, 3}
if we don'y know values define as int num[] = new int[4]
